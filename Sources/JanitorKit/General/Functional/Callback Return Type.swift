/// Okay so I had this idea where any time you have a function that doesn't return normally but instead promises to call
/// a callback should have some way for the compiler to enforce that. And I figure the most natural way to do that in
/// the current Swift language version is to have that function return a standard "callback type". So if you miss
/// calling the callback on a branch it'll complain that there's a void return from a non-void function, and if you
/// call the callback without returning it'll complain that the value is unused. I don't know if this will end up being
/// a Good Idea™, but I figure this smaller project is a great place to try it out.

    /// special callback return type.
